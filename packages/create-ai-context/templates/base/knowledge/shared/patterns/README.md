This directory contains proven solutions to common problems encountered in the codebase.

## Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `api/` | API design and implementation patterns |
| `data/` | Data handling, validation, transformation |
| `ui/` | User interface components and interactions |

## Pattern Template

Each pattern document should include:

```markdown
# Pattern Name

## Problem
What problem does this pattern solve?

## Context
When should this pattern be applied?

## Solution
How does the pattern work?

## Code Example
Concrete implementation example.

## Consequences
Trade-offs and considerations.

## Related Patterns
Links to related patterns.
```

## Adding a Pattern

1. Identify a recurring problem with a proven solution
2. Create document in appropriate category
3. Follow the template structure
4. Include working code examples
5. Reference actual codebase usage

## Using Patterns

1. Identify the problem you're solving
2. Check relevant category for existing patterns
3. Adapt the pattern to your specific context
4. Reference the pattern in your implementation

## Pattern Quality Criteria

- **Proven**: Used successfully in production
- **Documented**: Clear explanation and examples
- **Maintained**: Updated when implementation changes
- **Reviewed**: Approved by team lead or senior developer
