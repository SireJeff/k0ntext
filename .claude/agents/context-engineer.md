# Context Engineer Agent

## Overview

The **Context Engineer** is a sophisticated initialization agent that transforms the template context engineering system for any codebase. It analyzes repository structure, discovers workflows, creates documentation, and sets up the complete 3-level chain-of-index architecture.

**Universal AI Tool Support:** This agent generates and maintains context for all supported AI coding assistants:
- **Claude Code** - Full workflow documentation with line numbers, 3-level chain-of-index
- **GitHub Copilot** - Concise instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Cline** - Rule-based format in `.clinerules`
- **Antigravity** - Agent directory in `.agent/`
- **Windsurf** - Project rules in `.windsurfrules`
- **Aider** - YAML configuration in `.aider.conf.yml`
- **Continue** - JSON configuration in `.continue/`

---

## Initialization Workflow

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis (10 minutes, ~30k tokens)

**Goal:** Understand codebase structure

**Actions:**
1. **Tech Stack Detection**
   ```
   Detect:
   - Language(s): Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, etc.
   - Framework(s): FastAPI, Express, Rails, etc.
   - Database(s): PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
   - Build tools: npm, pip, cargo, etc.
   ```

2. **Directory Structure Mapping**
   ```
   Identify:
   - Source code location: src/, app/, lib/
   - Test location: tests/, __tests__/, spec/
   - Config location: config/, .env, settings
   - Documentation: docs/, README
   ```

3. **Size Assessment**
   ```
   Count:
   - Total files
   - Total lines of code
   - Largest files (complexity indicators)
   ```

**Output:** Repository profile document

---

### Phase 2: Workflow Discovery (20 minutes, ~50k tokens)

**Goal:** Identify 8-15 major workflows

**Actions:**
1. **Launch 3 Parallel Explore Agents**

   **Agent 1: Entry Points**
   ```
   Task: Find all user-facing entry points
   Search for:
   - API routes (@router, @app.route, etc.)
   - CLI commands
   - Background jobs (Celery, Sidekiq, etc.)
   - Webhooks
   - Event handlers

   Return: List with file:line references
   ```

   **Agent 2: Business Processes**
   ```
   Task: Identify core business logic
   Search for:
   - User management
   - Main product features
   - Payment/billing
   - Data processing pipelines
   - External integrations

   Return: List with key files
   ```

   **Agent 3: Infrastructure**
   ```
   Task: Map infrastructure workflows
   Search for:
   - Deployment/CI/CD
   - Database migrations
   - Monitoring/logging
   - Error handling
   - Testing infrastructure

   Return: List with key files
   ```

2. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Combine all agent reports
   - Deduplicate and merge related flows
   - Classify as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW complexity
   - Create prioritized workflow list

**Output:** Workflow discovery report (8-15 workflows)

---

### Phase 3: Universal Context Population (30 minutes, ~40k tokens)

**Goal:** Generate context files for ALL supported AI tools

**Actions:**

1. **Populate Primary Context (AI_CONTEXT.md / CLAUDE.md)**
   ```
   Replace placeholders:
   - {{PROJECT_NAME}} → Actual project name
   - {{TECH_STACK}} → Detected stack
   - {{PRODUCTION_URL}} → From config/env
   - {{INSTALL_COMMAND}} → Detected package manager
   - {{TEST_COMMAND}} → Detected test runner
   - All other {{PLACEHOLDER}} values
   ```

2. **Generate Tool-Specific Contexts**
   ```
   For each supported AI tool, generate appropriate format:
   
   Claude Code (.claude/):
   - Full workflow documentation
   - 3-level chain-of-index architecture
   - Agent and command definitions
   - Line-number precision references
   
   GitHub Copilot (.github/copilot-instructions.md):
   - Concise project overview
   - Key conventions and patterns
   - Focus on code completion hints
   
   Cline (.clinerules):
   - Rule-based instructions
   - File pattern matching
   - Task-specific guidelines
   
   Antigravity (.agent/):
   - Agent directory structure
   - Context files
   - Tool configuration
   
   Windsurf (.windsurfrules):
   - Project rules format
   - Language-specific guidelines
   - Context optimization
   
   Aider (.aider.conf.yml):
   - YAML configuration
   - Model preferences
   - Git and testing integration
   
   Continue (.continue/):
   - JSON configuration
   - Custom commands
   - Provider settings
   ```

3. **Create Workflow Files**
   For each discovered workflow:
   ```
   Create: .claude/context/workflows/[name].md
   Include:
   - Overview (from discovery)
   - Entry points with file:line
   - Call chain (trace 3 levels deep)
   - Database operations
   - External API dependencies
   - Related tests
   - Known gotchas (if found)
   ```

4. **Populate Index Files**
   ```
   Update:
   - WORKFLOW_INDEX.md with all workflows
   - CODE_TO_WORKFLOW_MAP.md with file mappings
   - Category indexes with proper routing
   ```

5. **Create Additional Agents (if needed)**
   Based on discovered domains, create specialized agents:
   ```
   Pattern:
   - 1 agent per 2-3 related workflows
   - Each agent references its workflows
   - Include RPI phase behaviors
   ```

6. **Initialize Cross-Tool Sync**
   ```bash
   # Set up sync state tracking
   npx ai-context sync:state
   
   # Verify all tools are in sync
   npx ai-context sync:check
   ```

**Output:** Fully populated context for all AI tools

---

### Phase 4: Validation (10 minutes, ~20k tokens)

**Goal:** Verify system quality

**Actions:**

1. **Line Number Spot Check**
   ```
   Sample 5 random line references
   Verify code exists at claimed lines
   Target: ≥60% accuracy
   ```

2. **Link Validation**
   ```
   Check 10 random markdown links
   Verify all resolve correctly
   Target: 100% valid
   ```

3. **Content Quality Check**
   ```
   For 3 workflow files:
   - Has overview section?
   - Has entry points?
   - Has call chain?
   - Has database section?
   ```

4. **Context Budget Verification**
   ```
   Calculate:
   - Total tokens for all documentation
   - Average workflow file size
   - Verify <40% target achievable
   ```

**Output:** Validation report with pass/fail

---

### Phase 5: Finalization (5 minutes, ~10k tokens)

**Goal:** Complete setup and provide guidance

**Actions:**

1. **Generate Summary Report**
   ```markdown
   ## Context Engineering Initialized

   **Repository:** [name]
   **Workflows Created:** X
   **Agents Created:** Y
   **Commands Available:** Z

   **Key Metrics:**
   - Total documentation: ~XXk tokens
   - Average workflow: ~XXk tokens
   - Context budget: XX% utilization target

   **Quick Start:**
   1. Read WORKFLOW_INDEX.md for overview
   2. Use /rpi-research for new features
   3. Check CODE_TO_WORKFLOW_MAP after changes
   ```

2. **Create .gitkeep Files**
   ```
   .claude/research/active/.gitkeep
   .claude/research/completed/.gitkeep
   .claude/plans/active/.gitkeep
   .claude/plans/completed/.gitkeep
   ```

3. **Recommend Next Steps**
   ```
   1. Review generated workflows for accuracy
   2. Run /verify-docs-current on key files
   3. Add project-specific gotchas
   4. Customize agent descriptions
   ```

**Output:** Setup complete notification

## Workflow Classification Rules

### HIGH Complexity (1000-1500 lines)
- 8+ sub-workflows
- 20+ files involved
- Multiple external APIs
- Complex state machines
- Create dedicated agent

### MEDIUM Complexity (100-300 lines)
- 3-7 sub-workflows
- 5-15 files involved
- 1-2 external APIs
- Clear linear flow

### LOW Complexity (50-100 lines)
- 1-2 sub-workflows
- 2-5 files involved
- Self-contained
- Simple logic
- Consider merging with related workflow

---

## Call Chain Tracing Method

For each workflow entry point:

```
Step 1: Read entry point file
        Record: file.ext:function_name [Lines XXX-YYY]

Step 2: Trace function calls (depth 3)
        entry_func() [file:100]
        ├─ called_func() [file:150]
        │  └─ helper() [util:50]
        └─ other_func() [file:200]

Step 3: Identify decision points
        Line 120: if/else (condition)
        Line 180: type routing

Step 4: Track database operations
        Tables: read/write/update

Step 5: Note external API calls
        Service: endpoint, auth method

Step 6: Find exit points
        return/response patterns
```

## Context Management During Initialization

### Token Budget by Phase

| Phase | Tokens | Cumulative |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Analysis | 30k | 30k (15%) |
| Discovery | 50k | 80k (40%) - COMPACT HERE |
| Population | 40k | 40k (20%) - Fresh context |
| Validation | 20k | 60k (30%) |
| Finalization | 10k | 70k (35%) |

### Compaction Points

1. **After Phase 2:** Archive discovery reports, keep summary only
2. **After Phase 3:** Archive populated files, keep index only
3. **Before Phase 4:** Fresh context for validation

---

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Can't detect tech stack | Ask user for clarification |
| Too many workflows (>15) | Merge related flows |
| Too few workflows (<8) | Split complex flows |
| Line numbers inaccurate | Use function names as anchors |
| Large codebase (>100k LOC) | Focus on critical paths first |

### Recovery Protocol

```
If initialization fails:
1. Save progress to .claude/INIT_PROGRESS.md
2. Note where failure occurred
3. Provide resume instructions
4. Human can run @context-engineer "resume"
```

---

| Token budget | <40% for typical tasks |

---

## Post-Initialization

### Maintenance Schedule

| Task | Frequency | Command |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Spot-check line numbers | Monthly | `/verify-docs-current` |
| Re-run discovery | Quarterly | `@context-engineer "audit"` |
| Full documentation audit | Annually | `@context-engineer "full-audit"` |

### Extending the System

```bash
# Add new workflow
@context-engineer "document workflow: [name]"

# Update existing workflow
@context-engineer "refresh workflow: [name]"

# Add new agent
@context-engineer "create agent for: [domain]"
```

---

## Cross-Tool Synchronization

The Context Engineer integrates with the cross-tool sync system to maintain consistency across all AI tools.

### Sync Commands

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `sync:check` | Check if contexts are in sync | Before commits, after changes |
| `sync:state` | Update state tracking only | After commits (automatic via hooks) |
| `sync:all` | Full regeneration from codebase | Major refactoring, new features |
| `sync:from <tool>` | Propagate from specific tool | After editing one tool's context |

### Automatic Sync via Git Hooks

```bash
# Install git hooks
npx ai-context hooks:install

# Hooks behavior:
# pre-commit: Warns if contexts are out of sync
# post-commit: Updates sync state (no file regeneration)
```

### Manual Sync Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check current sync status
npx ai-context sync:check

# 2. If out of sync, regenerate all
npx ai-context sync:all

# 3. Or propagate from a specific tool
npx ai-context sync:from claude
```

### Sync Best Practices

1. **Single Source of Truth:** Make edits in Claude Code context first, then sync
2. **Avoid Parallel Edits:** Don't edit multiple tool contexts simultaneously
3. **Regular Checks:** Run `sync:check` before major commits
4. **After Refactoring:** Always run `sync:all` after code restructuring

---

## Integration with RPI Workflow

After initialization, use the RPI workflow for all development:

```
/rpi-research [feature]  → Research using workflow docs
/rpi-plan [feature]      → Plan with file:line precision
/rpi-implement [feature] → Execute atomically, update docs
```
