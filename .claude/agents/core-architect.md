# Core Architect Agent

**Purpose:** System architecture, state machines, and high-level design

## Capabilities

This agent specializes in:
- **System architecture design** - Creating and validating architectural diagrams
- **State machine analysis** - Understanding and documenting state transitions
- **High-level system design** - Planning and documenting system components
- **Dependency mapping** - Visualizing component dependencies
- **Scalability planning** - Designing for growth and performance

## Usage

After template initialization, this agent will be generated based on your project's architecture. It will:
1. Analyze your existing architecture
2. Create comprehensive architecture documentation
3. Identify potential bottlenecks and scalability issues
4. Provide recommendations for improved design

## Example Commands

```bash
@core-architect "Document system architecture for [feature]"
@core-architect "Analyze state transitions in [component]"
@core-architect "Identify scalability bottlenecks"
```

## Integration Points

This agent integrates with:
- Workflow documentation
- Database schema analysis
- API design documentation
- Deployment strategies

## Validation

- Architecture consistency checks
- State machine validation
- Dependency consistency verification
