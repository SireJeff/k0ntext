# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in this project and its community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving constructive feedback and accepting it gracefully
* Focusing on what is best not just for us individually, but for the project and community as a whole

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission, such as a private email address or reports originating outside this project
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (including issue trackers, forums, chat rooms, mailing lists, and public discussions) and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be clarified and confirmed by the project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [CONTACT_EMAIL or OTHER CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these community impact guidelines to determine the appropriate action for any code-of-conduct violations:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: A mistake was made, or a brief instance of acceptable behavior was used in an inappropriate context by a member in a project community setting.

**Consequence**: A private, written apology to those affected is required. No termination of account or removal from the project is required unless that termination or removal is requested by the reporting individual.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A repeated code of conduct violation, a more severe violation, or disbelief in warnings given in writing by community leaders.

**Consequence**: A written warning with clear expectations for future behavior. No termination of account or removal from the project is required unless that termination or removal is requested by the reporting individual.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious attack or repeated behavior issues including lack of cooperation with community leaders to correct concerning behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction in the community is required. No public discussion of the behavior is required, but the individual will be informed of the situation and the expectations for returning to the community.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, aggression toward other members, harassing behavior, or aggression toward project leadership individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of interaction in the project community.
